### Mouse Wheel Buttons

This is a Browser Extension that adds 2 floating Bubbles to scroll smoothly up or down the current Webpage in place of the Scroll Wheel.


### Idea/Need of this Extension

As i am using an older wireless Mouse to Navigate on my TV and my Mouse Scroll Wheel decided a long time ago that regardless of which direction i scroll in, it is ignored and randomized, it was time to find a Solution that lets me Scroll in the Direction i want when i want it.
Hence this Extension was born.

### Build Process

As i was curious how well an AI would build this Extension i tried using ChatGPT free tier.
In about 20 minutes and 6-7 revision the Extension was build with the only contribution i did was the Prompt that let the AI lose and 3 SVGs from older Projects that did fit here.
